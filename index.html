<p>This site is a resource for teaching yourself to be what I like to call a "console cowboy."  </p>
<p>If you take the time to read through all of the information contained herein, you probably won't be able to walk into Google and get a job building AIs to take over the world.  However, you <em>will</em> be able to understand the steps you need to take to get to the point where you can, and it will be much easier for you to take those steps if that's something you want to do.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimerwarningspreachy-stuff">Disclaimer/Warnings/Preachy Stuff</h2>
<p>The information contained on this site has the potential to give you a lot of power- and with great power comes great responsibility.  While that may sound like a cliche, it is arguably the most important piece of information that I can pass along.  If you study all of these materials and practice enough, you will be able to do things that are commonly referred to as 'hacking' (for instance, with only a rudimentary understanding of networking and wireless protocols, you will be able to exploit insecure wireless networks).  However, just because you CAN do something with technology does not mean that you SHOULD do that thing.  There are very real consequences for using technology in an unethical fashion- and while I cannot actively prevent you from doing so, I want to stress the point that it isn't a good idea.  </p>
<p>Blackhat hackers are the ones that are the most popular in the media. These hackers are known to be the ‘bad guys’ since they wreak havoc in multiple industries and are usually motivated by personal or financial gain. Their goals are to steal personal information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. for malicious reasons or to sell to identity thieves. Blackhat hackers do not ask permission to infiltrate a system, and many of their activities are illegal.</p>
<p>Whitehat hackers are the opposite of blackhat hackers, the whitehat hackers are the ‘good guys’ or ethical hackers. Yes, they still compromise systems but they do it with permission. Many times their goal is to find a security vulnerability that they will disclose to the organization so that improvements can be made to improve their defenses. This is known as penetration testing and is just one example of an exercise performed by a whitehat hacker. When a whitehat hacker informs developers of vulnerabilities they have found, patches and security improvements can be made before the system is ever compromised.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from a talk given by a Blackhat to a group of wannabe Blackhats on the "deep web:"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You'll find your business opportunities and your own worth in the community skyrocket if you become an elite who knows tech.  Many people will want you to be their contact solely for the fact that you're among the few that know tech to the extent many do not.</p>
<p>The only bonds that tie in the blackhat community are fear and profit.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this isn't a community that does things for fun or to make a point. You're dealing with drug kingpins, criminal syndicates, money launderers, and other blackhats who only care for their personal flow of coin and the flow of commerce.</p>
<p>We are not in this for fame. We are not in this for fun. The game is a tad bit different because you're dealing with greed. Like true greed. Thousands. Hundreds of thousands. Millions. Billions in some cases.</p>
<p>If they find you a threat they'll try to come after your contacts and credibility. Whether it means sabotaging your business in some way, or ruining your name with something embarrassing in an attempt to have you lose contacts.</p>
<p>They'll try whatever they can to threaten your flow of coin, or your life."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've included this so that you know exactly what you'd be getting into if you choose to wear a black hat and use this information for the wrong purposes.  Operating as part of the Blackhat community isn't only dangerous because of the risk that you'll be caught by law enforcement, it's also dangerous because real Blackhats are bad guys in every sense of the phrase.  They're criminals out for personal gain, and they have no problem with taking action against people who get in their way, or attacking people that make themselves easy targets. Never forget- no matter how good you are, there is always someone out there who is better, and if you give them a reason to, they will be able to find you, and because of their superior technical knowledge, the number of people that will be able to help you when this happens is very low.  If you get yourself in with the wrong people, you can very easily face a choice between letting them ruin your life, finances, and relationships, or admitting what you've done to the police and possibly going to prison.</p>
<p>All of this can be boiled down to the following rules of thumb for working with 'advanced' technology:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don't ever do anything you wouldn't want your family to know about.</p>
<p>The internet never forgets, and ANYTHING you do on the internet can end up published for everyone to see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay off TOR (the "Deep Web").</p>
<p>It is not a glamorous place, and for every piece of useful information that you might find, there are thousands of pieces of information that could get you in major trouble with the law (in the best case), or with hardened criminals (in the worst case).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you stumble upon information that seems confidential or sensitive, don't share it with anyone except the owner (or the authorities, if it happens to be illegal).</p>
<p>When people learn that you understand technology at a high level, you will be presented with a lot of situations where you'll be dealing with other people's data.  For instance, one of your friends might have a computer that's running slow and ask you to take a look at it, and during this process, you might accidentally see an embarrassing email that they sent.  While it might be tempting to share the contents of the email with someone else for a laugh or personal gain, don't do it- just pretend that you never saw it.  The only exception to this is that if it's something that you suspect is illegal, you should notify the proper authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treat all computers like houses.    </p>
<p>You wouldn't leave your front door unlocked, so don't leave your accounts open or protected by weak passwords.</p>
<p>You wouldn't kick down the door of someone's house to get in, so don't try to break into other people's computers.</p>
<p>You wouldn't invite random strangers into your house, so don't download things from sources that you don't trust.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
