#Module 3: Discrete Mathematics (OPTIONAL)

While this module isn't really required to "learn to code," I would recommend that you at least take a stab at it- watch a few of the videos here and there while you're 
working through other modules, and see if they're relevant to what you want out of this course of study.

##What is Discrete Mathematics?
Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics devoted to the logical analysis of systems and countable sets (set theory).  It's much different than the kind of math 
that you'll learn in "math class-" I find that it's more like a series of puzzles, rather than a series of problems and formulas used to solve them.  The kind of 
thinking introduced in discrete mathematics is very similar to the kind of thinking that you'll need to write effective programs and attack the complex problems that 
you're likely to encounter in higher-level programming exercises.  In addition, you'll encounter a lot of concepts that serve as an introduction to pieces of higher 
mathematics that come into play in all sorts of modern computing tasks.

You can supplement the learning from the above course with the book [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 4th Edition.](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp/dp/0495391328)
