#Module 2: Bash Scripting

Once you have a working knowledge of the Linux operating system, you might find it useful to start automating various tasks within the system, or writing little utility programs for yourself to make it easier to perform certain tasks.  This is the first point where you're going to be doing "real programming."  The reason that I recommend that people learn bash scripting is because:

1. Doing so does not require any additional tools other than those included by default in Linux. 

2. Bash isn't an "object oriented" language, and because of this is written in a more linear fashion than your run of the mill modern program.  Learning to program 
linearly before learning to program in an object-oriented context will help you make the transition in a much smoother fashion, and more directly understand the 
advantages/disadvantages of an object-oriented paradigm.

3. Bash scripting is one of the most useful tools in the tech industry, because it allows you to automate complex tasks that you find yourself performing on a regular 
basis.
