<h2 id="git-started">'Git' Started</h2>
<p>Before you get started with this part, I would recommend that you set up a <a href="https://www.github.com">Github account</a> and install git on your virtual Linux machine (if it isn't 
installed already).  Git is essentially a system for 'saving' entire folders and tracking changes that you make to files.  This might not seem important when you're 
dealing with smaller applications, but as you start to make things that are more complex, it can be a very valuable tool for making sure that you don't lose your hard 
work.  Github is a free online service that you can use in conjunction with git to store your files on the cloud, share them, and access them from any machine.  If you 
ever end up applying for a job as a developer, companies will usually ask you for your github account so that they can look at the projects you've worked on in the past 
and get a sense of your skill level- think of it kind of like a portfolio of your work.  You can also use your github to store assignments that you've worked on, papers 
you've written, classroom notes, or just about anything else.  It's also really neat to be able to look back over your past code and see how far you've progressed since 
you've started.  Overall, it's an extremely useful and powerful tool!</p>
<p>There's a great interactive tutorial for learning git that you can find <a href="https://try.github.io/">here.</a></p>
<h2 id="now-you-are-ready-to-learn-to-code-with-ruby">Now You are Ready to 'Learn to Code' with Ruby</h2>
<p>There are a zillion programming languages out there, and all of them have their particular advantages and disadvantages.  However, the important thing to remember (and 
something that teachers may not always tell you) is that once you've learned one programming language, learning others is pretty easy by comparison.  Because of this, I 
generally recommend that people learn Ruby as their first language, because its grammar and syntax are very intuitive and easy to understand.  Learning Ruby also has the 
advantage of giving you experience in a language that is in high demand, because it is used by many companies to develop complex websites and services using the Ruby on 
Rails framework.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dji9ALCgfpM">This video will give you a good introduction to the Ruby language and the kinds of things it can do</a>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the best book on Ruby ever written is "Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby-" it's basically a comic book that teaches you Ruby, and you can find it 
<a href="http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html">here.</a></p>
<p>You should also take a look at "Learn Ruby the Hard Way," which you can find <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html">here</a>.  It's not nearly as fun as Why's 
Poignant Guide, but it does go into more detail and includes more exercises for you to work on.</p>
<p>If you ever need to know more about a particular class or function in Ruby, you can also search the official Ruby documentation <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="adding-rails-to-your-ruby">Adding Rails to your Ruby</h2>
<p>Now that you're a seasoned Ruby veteran, it's time to learn the web framework for Ruby, called "Ruby on Rails," "Rails," or "RoR" for short. This framework will allow 
you to develop powerful, fully-featured websites with the Ruby language.</p>
<p>You can get a basic introduction to Rails through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-rails/lessons/start/exercises/start-hello-rails?action=lesson_resume">Codeacademy's free Rails 
course</a>.</p>
<p>Once you've finished that, it's time to tackle <strong>the definitive guide to Rails-</strong> Michael Hartl's <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/">"The Ruby on Rails Tutorial."</a></p>
<p>This tutorial is not for the faint of heart- it may take you weeks to complete, but if you can make it through, you've got what it takes to be a web developer.</p>
<p>After you've completed Hartl's tutorial, there's just one more step in between you and Ruby greatness: the <a href="http://rubykoans.com">Ruby Koans</a>.  The Koans are intended to 
teach you about Test Driven Development (TDD), which is a very in-demand skill in the development industry- most junior developers begin their careers writing tests, and 
if you can do it in the wild, you can do it in an office.</p>
